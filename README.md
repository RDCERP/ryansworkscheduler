## Ryans Work Scheduler

#### I open the planner
#### Create a schedule
#### Current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
#### Time blocks for standard business hours are present
#### Time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
#### I can enter an event
#### I can click the save button for that time block
#### The text for that event is saved in local storage
#### I can refresh the page and the data still exists
#### Timer uses moment
